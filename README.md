# Nous
Nous is an entirely fictional programming language with hypnotic overtones, designed to be accessible to both programming-inclined hypnotists, as well as hypnosis subjects (referred to in documentation as "Nous interpreters"). The intent of Nous is to have what seems like a real programming language that is fine-tuned to the wants and needs of a hypnosis-inclined theming.

One of the core creative ideas of Nous is the idea of manipulating the `MIND`, `BODY`, and `SPIRIT`. For more information on this, please read [Aspects.md](Documentation/Concepts/Aspects.md).

# Rules of the Fiction
Although Nous is a fictional programming language, its operation does still come with a few global rules.

* Nous scripts are contained in `.nu` files. If you were to run a Nous script from the command line, it would look like `nous script.nu`.
* Due to the subjective nature of Nous as a whole and the reasoning skills it requires, it CANNOT be run on any machine or entity that is not sapient.
* Living entities do not come with Nous support by default; it must be added manually by a programmer. Sapient machines can either be built with Nous support, or have it installed afterward by a programmer.

# Contribution Guidelines
If you wish to have a concept or function added to Nous, make a pull request to the repository with your desired addition formatted in a .MD file. Keep in mind that the Nous team has the right to accept or deny any contribution to the "canon" version of Nous for any reason.

The formatting of the file should be in-line with the quality and formatting of any piece that was authored by the Nous team.

Your .MD file should credit yourself at the top of the page, in the format `<sub>Authored by (name)</sub>`.

If you are making edits to someone else's contribution, on a new line below the authorship credit, you should put `<sub>Edited by (name)</sub>`.

All visual examples of code should be properly formatted with four-space indents.

## Concepts
Concepts should be explained in-depth so that any newcomer to Nous may easily grasp the idea, while understanding the possible intricacies of the concept.

Clear language should be used. If a code example is included, it should include `NOTE`s so the reader can grasp each part of the code.

## Functions
All entries for functions should:
* Be named after the name of the function itself (for example, the documentation file for `CHAIN` is titled `CHAIN.md`.)
* Display the usage of the function on its own.
* Describe the function in-detail, as well as its practical applications.
* Contain an example of code using the function, as well as a description of what the code does.

## Examples
This is possibly the loosest contribution category, as Examples are just Nous scripts on their own.

Preferably, Nous examples should contain `NOTE`s to display to the reader what is going on within the code outside of the context of reading the code itself.

# Nous
Nous is an entirely fictional programming language with hypnotic overtones, designed to be accessible to both programming-inclined hypnotists, as well as hypnosis subjects (referred to in documentation as "Nous interpreters"). The intent of Nous is to have what seems like a real programming language that is fine-tuned to the wants and needs of a hypnosis-inclined theming.

One of the core creative ideas of Nous is the idea of manipulating the MIND, BODY, and SPIRIT. For more information on this, please read [Aspects.md](Documentation/Concepts/Aspects.md).

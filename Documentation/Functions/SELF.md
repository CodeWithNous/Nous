Usage: `SELF`

The SELF function is a special function that, when called, returns a variable that represents the Nous interpreter as a whole. Note that this differs from the sense of identity that can be read or altered through various aspects in the SPIRIT group, and has more use cases than the physical sense of self that can be read or altered as [WORLD.self]. Its uses are subjective and context sensitive, so ensure that the Nous interpreter running the code understands the intended purpose for the best results.

EXAMPLE:
```
PERCEIVE ([SPIRIT.relationships/crushes] += SELF)
EXIT
```

The above code will cause the Nous interpreter to experience feelings of attraction towards themself.

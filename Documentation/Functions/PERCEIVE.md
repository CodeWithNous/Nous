Usage: `PERCEIVE ([GROUP.aspect] <operation>)`

The PERCEIVE function causes a change in the specified aspect using the specified operation. Note that all changes are made on a mental level and can be interpreted differently depending on the Nous interpreter.

Example:

```
WHILE ([MIND.consciousness] > 0)
    {
    PERCEIVE ([MIND.consciousness] --)
    }
EXIT
```

The above code will gradually lower the Nous interpreter's consciousness until it reaches 0.
